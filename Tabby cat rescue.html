      <h2>The History of Tabby Cats Rescue</h2>
      <p>
        Tabby Cats Rescue is a small, independent cat rescue centre run by Hazel O’
        Brien and her husband Éamonn at their home in the East Riding of Yorkshire
        town of Pocklington. Hazel has commissioned you to design and develop a
        website for their rescue centre to help publicise the cats they have available
        for adoption and encourage donations. <br></br>

        Tabby Cats Rescue was established in May 2004 when Hazel found a box containing 5
        kittens (approximately 3 weeks old) at the side of the road. Hazel tried to find
        a cat rescue centre to take in these kittens and put them up for adoption, but
        was unable to find spaces for them altogether as all the rescue centres were overrun.
        The kittens were so young that Hazel was reluctant to separate them across different
        cat rescue centres. Hazel and Éamonn already had 3 cats of their own, so they
        couldn’t keep the kittens permanently. So instead, they decided to take care of
        the kittens until they were old enough to be rehomed and then try to rehome the
        kittens themselves. Éamonn is a skilled carpenter and quickly got to work building
        a nice shelter for the kittens in the back garden of the bungalow. As such, Tabby
        Cats Rescue was born! <br></br>

      <h2>After this...</h2>
      Since that day in May 2004, Tabby Cats Rescue has expanded and now has room for up
      to 30 adults cats to live comfortably and has rehomed hundreds of cats and kittens.
      From pedigree Ragdoll cats to strays, all cats are welcome at Tabby Cats Rescue no
      matter what their age or condition. If any cat is unsuitable for rehoming, perhaps
      as a result of being harmed or mistreated, then Tabby Cats Rescue will take care
      of them permanently. <br></br>

      Cats are only rehomed to people who can demonstrate a love of cats and a commitment to
      loving them and taking care of them properly. Some cats are suitable to families with
      children, while others are more appropriate to older, child free environments. Some cats
      are able to be rehomed into locations with an outside environment, while others are
      better in an indoor-only set up. <br></br>

      All cats that are over the age of 6 months are neutered before rehoming. If adopting a
      cat that is younger than 6 months, Tabby Cats Rescue will provide a voucher for half
      price neutering at a York-based veterinarian. <br></br>

      Tabby Cats Rescue is funded through the generosity of the public, through fundraising
      events hosted by volunteers, and a small fee charged to people adopting the cats.
