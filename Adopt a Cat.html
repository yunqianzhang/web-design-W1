        <h2>How to Rehome From Us</h2>
        <p>
            We work really hard to find each adopter the right cat. Sadly, many of the
            cats in our care have been victims of cruelty which means they often require
            a period of rehabilitation before they are ready to be rehomed. When our
            volunteers believe they are ready they will observe their behaviour and give
            them a health check which helps us match their needs to a suitable person
            or family.
        </p>
        <h2>Special Homes for Special Cats</h2>
        <p>
            Many of the cats in our care have had a tough time, so it’s very important
            that their next home is the right home and a home for life. That’s why we ask
            anyone who’s thinking of rehoming from us to fill in an application form
            before being interviewed with one of our rescue centre volunteers. We find this
            is the best way to find out more about you and help you to choose the right cat.
            We really believe there is a home to suit every cat in our care. But, sometimes
            it just takes a little time to find our feline friends the perfect home.
        </p>
        <h2>Home Visits</h2>
        <p>
            We carry out a home-visit and in some cases suggest minor changes that help
            ensure your home is as cat friendly as possible. We’ll also call or visit
            after your cat has moved in to make sure you and your new cat are adjusting
            well to your new life together.
        </p>
        <h2>Neutering</h2>
        <p>
            All cats that are over the age of 6 months are neutered before rehoming. If
            adopting a cat that is younger than 6 months, Tabby Cats Rescue will provide
            a voucher for half price neutering at a York-based veterinarian.
        </p>
        <h2>Fee</h2>
        <p>
            A fee of £50 per cat is charged upon rehoming a cat which contributes to the 
            running costs of Tabby Cat Rescue.
