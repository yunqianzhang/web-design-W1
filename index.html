 <h2>The History of Tabby Cats Rescue</h2>

  <p>
    Tabby Cats Rescue is a small, independent cat rescue centre run by Hazel O’Brien 
    and her husband Éamonn at their home in the East Riding of Yorkshire town of 
    Pocklington. Hazel has commissioned you to design and develop a website for 
    their rescue centre to help publicise the cats they have available for adoption 
    and encourage donations. <br></br>

    Tabby Cats Rescue was established in May 2004 when Hazel found a box containing 
    5 kittens (approximately 3 weeks old) at the side of the road. Hazel tried to 
    find a cat rescue centre to take in these kittens and put them up for adoption, 
    but was unable to find spaces for them altogether as all the rescue centres were 
    overrun. The kittens were so young that Hazel was reluctant to separate them 
    across different cat rescue centres. Hazel and Éamonn already had 3 cats of
     their own, so they couldn’t keep the kittens permanently. So instead, they 
     decided to take care of the kittens until they were old enough to be rehomed 
     and then try to rehome the kittens themselves. Éamonn is a skilled carpenter and 
     quickly got to work building a nice shelter for the kittens in the back garden 
     of the bungalow. As such, Tabby Cats Rescue was born!
