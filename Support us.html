            <h3>Fundraising</h3>
            <p>
                The Tabby Cats Rescue has been operating for 20 years and we have hundreds of
                cats in this time. If you would like to go the extra mile to help cats in need
                and protect a piece of Pocklington history then we have plenty of fun ideas
                down below.
                <br></br>
                <strong>We couldn’t do the work we do without your support.</strong>
                <br></br>
                Fundraising helps us give the best possible care to our cats in need. It can also
                be a fun experience for everyone involved. So if you love running, reading, dancing,
                baking, quizzing, climbing, writing, drawing, then do what you do best and shine for
                our beautiful cats and kittens. <br></br>

                After you’ve done your wonderful work raising funds, you’ll want to know how to send
                them to our cats in need!
